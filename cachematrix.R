## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## the function first set the value of y wich is the inverse of a simple matrix x then cache that value

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
y<<- -x
	get<- function()x
	list(y=y, get=get)
	}

## cacheSolve is a function that shows the inverse of the matrix 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        data<-x$get()
	y
}
